A perl script to recognize the transmembrane domains of multiple proteins. It is able to create a .txt file (out.txt) with the ID of a protein, the AC (responding to 
Uniprot) and the amount of Amino Acids. In a new line we have our sequence and below the sequence we have a line where "-" responds to non-transmembrane domains and 
"M" responds to transmembrane domains. As input file you are able to use any record from Uniprot in swiss-prot type of file (as transmem_proteins.swiss). 

To run this scrpit go to the directory where the script is and type this command: _transm_domains.pl transmem_proteins.swiss_
